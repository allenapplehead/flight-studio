# Flight Studio

With COVID restrictions lifting, more and more people are starting to travel once again. However, the pandemic made us forget the frustrating and time-consuming ordeal of comparing flight offers from different websites. Our group was inspired by the idea of a one-stop experience that made searching for flights easy and even fun. Thus, Flight Studio was born.
